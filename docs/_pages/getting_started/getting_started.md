This document will guide you through the installation process and will help you configure the library for the newest release.

In order to install the library for python 3.6 please refer to the README associated with that QF-Lib version: [QF-Lib for Python 3.6](https://github.com/quarkfin/qf-lib/tree/v1.0.0-alpha).

## Prerequisites
The library uses [WeasyPrint](https://weasyprint.readthedocs.io) to export documents to PDF. WeasyPrint requires additional dependencies, check the 
[platform-specific instructions for Linux, macOS and Windows installation](https://weasyprint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html).

In order to facilitate the GTK3+ installation process for Windows you can use 
[following installers](https://github.com/tschoonj/GTK-for-Windows-Runtime-Environment-Installer/releases). Download and run the latest 
`gtk3-runtime-x.x.x-x-x-x-ts-win64.exe` file to install the GTK3+.

## Installation

You can install `qf-lib` using the pip command:

```sh
pip install qf-lib
```

Alternatively, to install the library from sources, you can download the project and in the qf_lib directory 
(same one where you found this file after cloning the repository) execute the following command:

```sh
python setup.py install
```

## Tips on how to install optional data providers
* Bloomberg API (version: 3.16.2) installation:
    * `pip install --index-url=https://bcms.bloomberg.com/pip/simple/ blpapi==3.16.2`
    * Prebuilt binaries are provided for Python 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 in both 32 and 64 bits, for Windows, macOS, 
    and most versions of Linux. On Linux, 'pip' >= 19.0 is required to install these binaries.
 * Quandl Data Provider (version: 3.6.1):
    * `pip install quandl==3.6.1`
 * Interactive Brokers platform installation:
    * Download the TWS API Stable for your operating system (Version: API 9.76).
    * Link for windows msi file: `http://interactivebrokers.github.io/downloads/TWS%20API%20Install%20976.01.msi`.
    * Install TWS API by running the downloaded file.
    * Go to `TWS API\source\pythonclient` and run `python setup.py install`.

# Configuration
## Starting directory
Starting directory is used to turn relative paths into absolute paths. In many places you'll be required to specify
a path which should be relative to the starting directory. To set up starting directory one needs to either:
- call `set_starting_dir_abs_path("C:\abs\path\to\starting\directory")`
- or set `QF_STARTING_DIRECTORY` environment variable and put as value path to the project.
- For example the path might look like this: `C:\Users\user_name\workspace\qf-lib`

## Advanced configuration - Settings files
Many components from `qf-lib` require the `Settings` object as a dependency. To create it one needs to put in their Python code:
```python
from qf_lib.settings import Settings


settings_path = ...
secret_settings_path = ...
settings = Settings(settings_path, secret_settings_path)
```  
where `settings_path` is an absolute path of your file containing settings (JSON, described later) used
by the application and the `secret_settings_path` which is complementary to the settings file but contains secret data
(e.g. passwords) and thus mustn't be added to the CVS. When `Settings` object is created, it:
- loads settings defined in the `settings.json` file
- loads settings defined in the `secret_settings.json` file (if the file exists)
- loads settings defined in the `QUANTFIN_SECRET` environment variable (if the `secret_settings.json` file doesn't exist)
- merges both loaded sets of settings together.

Sample content of the `settings.json`:
```json
{
  "some_setting": "value of that setting",
  "another_setting": "value of another setting",
  "some_connection_settings": {
    "username": "john.smith"
  }
}
```

Sample content of the `secret_settings.json`:
```json
{
  "some_connection_settings": {
    "password": "my_secret_pass"
  }
}
```

## QF-Lib used settings
You may define your own settings and later on have them loaded into `Settings` object. However there are some, which are
required for some QF-Lib components to work correctly.

- Sample settings can be found in demo configuration `\qf-lib\demo_scripts\demo_configuration\config_files\demo_settings.json`
- Sample secret settings can be found in demo configuration `\qf-lib\demo_scripts\demo_configuration\config_files\demo_secret_settings.json`


NOTICE: all paths used in the settings should be relative to the starting directory. (which can be set either by using
`set_starting_dir_abs_path(path)` function or by setting `QF_STARTING_DIRECTORY` environment variable)

Below you'll find a list of examples that can be put into settings

**company_name and logo_path (optional)**

`settings.json`:
```json
    "company_name": "Sample Org Name",
    "logo_path": "path/to/logo.jpg"
```
Used by components producing tearsheets (in a form of PDFs). The company name and a logo is put in the header of those
tearsheets.

**document_css_directory (optional)**

`settings.json`:
```json
    "document_css_directory": "input/elements_css"
```
Setting used by the `PDFExporter` component to style the elements put in PDFs (e.g. tables, paragraphs, etc.).
If `document_css_directory` is not specified then the default style will be applied.

**bloomberg (optional)**

`settings.json`:
```json
  "bloomberg": {
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 8194
  }
```

Used by the `BloombergDataProvider`. To have this component running, first you need to have a Bloomberg subscription.
Then you need to have the BLPAPI running somewhere. Then you need to specify where the API is running by specifying its
host and port.

**email_templates_directory (optional)**

`settings.json`:
```json
  "email_templates_directory": "input/email_templates"
```

Setting used by the `EmailPublisher`. Email templates are HTML templates with placeholders (e.g. {{user.name}}).

**output_directory**

`settings.json`:
```json
  "output_directory": "output"
```
A relative path to the directory into which different components will put their output (e.g. generated tearsheets).

**smtp (optional)**

`settings.json`:
```json
  "smtp": {
    "host": "smtp.server.pl",
    "port": 587,
    "domain": "SOME_DOMAIN",
    "tls": true,
    "sender": "sample_user@some.domain.com"
  }
```

`secret_settings.json`:
```json
  "smtp": {
    "username": "sample_user",
    "password": "VeryStrong P4ssw0rd with s0me Polish special characters (to confuse the hacker)"
  }
```
SMTP settings used by the `EmailPublisher`.
