**Portara integration**

For Portara integration, we introduced `PortaraDataProvider` and the specific tickers: `PortaraTicker` and `PortaraFutureTicker`.
 
`PortaraDataProvider` is a dedicated data provider that loads Portara data for future contracts into the backtest. It supports both continuous series and individual contracts (tenors). The required format is .csv for pricing data (with headers) and .txt for expiration dates (as it is in Portara). Currently the only supported data frequencies are daily frequency and 1-minute bar frequency. After preloading 1-minute bars, it is possible to aggregate them selecting a different frequency in the get price method.
 
`PortaraTicker` is a simple ticker used with continuous data, and `PortaraFutureTicker` is used to work with tenors.
 
In order to see exemplary files which may be used with the PortaraDataProvider (e.g. structure of expiration
  dates file), check the mock files in the tests directory:
  qf_lib_tests > unit_tests > data_providers > portara > input_data.

The input files are the examples of the expected structure of the files (there are not directly from Portara)
 
To see examples using Portara data provider, check the demo scripts:
  demo_scripts > data_providers > portara
 
The files used in demo can be run with the data that is available here: [CQG Sample Data | Download CQG Data Factory Samples at PortaraCQG](
